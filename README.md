# Security Risk Assessment Report for Social Media Organization

---

As a security analyst working for a (**fictional**) social media organization, the organization recently experienced a major data breach. This data breach compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Due to this, the organization now wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent future attacks and breaches from occurring. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, I discovered four major vulnerabilities that are as follows:

1. The organization’s employees share passwords.
2. The administrator password for the database is set to its default.
3. The firewalls lack rules to filter traffic inbound and outbound network traffic.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is unused. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization will be at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

I have since written a security risk assessment analyzing the four major vulnerabilities and explaining methods that can be used to improve the organization's security posture, and secure users' data and the organization's network. *This security risk assessment can be found in this repository.*
